"""Outlet switches for the Anthem valve.

One switch per outlet, showing state and accepting commands — the same element does both,
like the Konnect app. Because ``is_on`` reads the valve's reported state rather than
remembering what Home Assistant last sent, a switch follows changes from **any** origin:
the app, the physical touchscreen, a preset, or another automation.

Outlets are addressed **per zone**, matching the hardware: a multi-outlet Anthem is
physically two valve bodies joined, and every API surface addresses them separately. That
also removes a whole class of bug — a global "outlet 1-6" numbering has to be split across
zones differently on every model (2+2 on a K-28211, 3+3 on a K-28212), and getting that
split wrong silently operates the wrong outlet.

Turning one on re-sends the complete valve command with that outlet's bit set and every
other outlet in both zones preserved, at whatever the zone's temperature and flow numbers
hold. The valve accepts no partial write.

Switches are **optimistic**: the toggle moves immediately and the reported state corrects it
about a second later when the valve echoes back. Without that, every tap would sit visibly
stuck for the round trip (measured 1.1-2.1 s on real hardware).

    It used to *pause* (``0x40``), which showed as "Paused" in the status sensor and reads
    better on a dashboard. That was given up on 2026-08-13 for a concrete reason: **a pause
    is byte-identical to the valve's own run-time cutoff**, which is internally
    ``{preset, action:"Off"}``. With the restart-on-cutoff option on, "Home Assistant stopped
    the shower" and "the valve timed out" were the same event on the wire, separated only by
    a 30 s grace window. Stopping with ``0x00`` makes them different by construction.

    **On activates preset ``SHOWER_ON_PRESET_ID``** — one call, no valve write. The valve has
    no "run my default", so a whole-shower start has to name a stored scene; the preset
    supplies the outlets, temperature, and flow that this entity cannot.

    **Not redundant with the outlet switches, despite both running water.** They answer
    different questions. An outlet switch opens *one* outlet at whatever temperature the
    zone already holds — manual control, one outlet at a time. This runs the shower the
    owner configured: outlets, temperature and flow together, in a single command, from a
    preset edited in the Konnect app rather than in this integration. Change that preset
    and this switch starts something different with no code change. The redundancy is only
    at the *off* end, where both stop the water.

    Which means **what "on" does is stored on the valve, not here.** Edit the preset in the
    Konnect app and this switch starts something different, with no code change — the reason
    the id is a constant rather than a hardcoded literal.

    """Whether to re-open a zone the valve closed on its own run-time limit.

    **This switch is the only control for the feature.** It began life alongside a
    config-flow checkbox writing the same option; the checkbox was removed 2026-08-22
    (see `config_flow.py`) because a setting buried behind *Configure* is neither visible
    on the device page nor reachable from an automation or a dashboard, and the switch is
    all three.

    **What it does when on:** the valve shuts a zone off once it has been running for
    `maximumRunTime` (15 minutes here, per zone rather than per outlet — see
    `anthem/runtime_cutoff.py`); this re-opens the outlets that were running so the
    shower carries on. It therefore **defeats a manufacturer cutoff, with no limit on
    repeats** — water keeps coming back for as long as somebody leaves it running, and the
    hardware stop is the thing being overridden. That is the owner's deliberate choice; see
    `CONF_RESTART_ON_RUNTIME_CUTOFF` in `const.py`. Every restart is logged at WARNING, and
    every decision, including the declines, goes to the cutoff debug log.

    ⚠️ **On an account with BOTH an Anthem valve and an Anthem Plus controller, the two Max
    Shower Durations must be set to the same value.** They are separate timers on separate
    devices and they signal differently — the valve **pauses** (`0x40`), the controller
    **stops** (`0x00`) — and this feature acts on the pause, because that is the only cut it
    can tell apart from somebody deliberately ending their shower. Measured across five case
    studies (`docs/case_studies/`), the valve fires marginally early and the controller
    marginally late, so with equal durations the valve always cuts first and there is always a
    pause to act on. **If the controller's is shorter, it stops the shower and nothing
    restarts it.** Since 2026-08-22 that mismatch is warned about only on evidence — a
    minute-boundary stop showing the controller preempting the valve (`runtime_cutoff.py`) —
    not nagged unconditionally at toggle or startup: the hub's number is not readable from
    the cloud, so the integration cannot know whether the durations differ until one fires.

    State lives in the config entry's **options**, per valve under `CONF_VALVES`, so the
    setting survives a restart.
    Writing options does not trigger a reload — the key is in `RELOAD_IGNORED_OPTION_KEYS`
    and `_async_update_listener` sees no reloadable difference — and the coordinator reads
    the flag live, so a toggle takes effect on the next message rather than needing a
    restart.

    **The problem this exists for.** The valve's warmup mode does not stay where it is put:
    the Anthem Plus hub writes it back to `warmUpDisabled` on every signed-in use of its web
    UI — a constant in the hub's login/UI routine, solved 2026-08-21 after six live
    reproductions in a day. Nothing reachable from outside the hub's firmware prevents it,
    so putting the mode back is the fix that exists. See `docs/gcs/api.md` §3h.

    **What this does.** When warmup goes to `warmUpDisabled` and this integration did not
    cause it — announced by the valve over MQTT, or discovered by the reconnect reseed after
    an MQTT outage (a hub sign-in during one causes exactly that; the reseed path acts since
    2026-08-22) — wait 60 seconds, re-check that it is still disabled, and set the mode back
    to the last enabled one seen on the valve. That target is remembered in the entry
    options, so it survives a restart and reinstates what the fixture actually had — never a
    default, because "all outlets" and "selected outlets" are different fixtures' worth of
    water. With no remembered mode it does nothing and says so.

    ⚠️ **This treats a symptom.** It cannot stop the hub's routine writing the field — that
    is hub firmware — and a restore is a write to Kohler's cloud like any other. It is off by
    default because only installs whose hub web UI gets used ever see the disable; turn it on
    when the reverting is actually bothering you.

    Three things it deliberately will not do:

    * **Undo you.** Choosing `Off` on the Warmup dropdown is a write this integration made,
      and a disable it caused is recognised and ignored. Otherwise `Off` would be unusable.
    * **Fight forever.** If the mode is disabled again after each restore, it stops after five
      consecutive attempts and logs why. A retry loop against something actively rewriting the
      field is not a fix, it is just traffic.
    * **Interrupt a shower.** The write is refused while water is running, mirroring the

    valve has no equivalent — every start there must specify the complete valve state, which
    is why the valve's shower switch activates a preset instead.

    Off stops **water only**, leaving music, steam, and lighting untouched. For a true
    system-wide stop use the System switch, which calls ``stopall``.

    ``is_on`` follows reported state rather than what we last sent, so a shower started from
    the touchscreen or the app shows up here too.

    **It reports the controller's view only — never the valve's.** A shower driven straight
    at the valve through ``solowritesystem`` — which is every shower Home Assistant starts —
    reaches this switch only if the controller happens to register it, which is unreliable
    (51 of 95 immediately, 12 late, 32 never; preset-driven ones never). That is the

    ``valvecontrol OFF`` can only stop a session the controller is party to. For whether
    water is physically running, read the **Anthem Valve** device's Shower on switch and
    sensors, which are authoritative.

    breakdown naming which. Off calls ``stopall``, the only command that idles everything.

    at the valve through ``solowritesystem`` is invisible here, because it is invisible to
    the controller — and ``stopall``, this switch's off action, would not stop it either.
    Scoping the switch to what its own off action can reach is the point: it stays honest
    about both. The **Anthem Valve** device owns the question "is water running".

    **The two directions are deliberately asymmetric, and this is the honest part.** There is
    no "start everything" concept: the controller cannot turn on music and steam and water
    from one command, and inventing a meaning would be guesswork. So turning it **on** runs
    the controller's default shower (``valvecontrol ON``) — the nearest thing to "on" the
