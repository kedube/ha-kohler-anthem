"""Binary sensors.

Two unrelated groups live here:

* **Valve diagnostics** — stream health, and per-zone and at-temperature readings. Mostly
  disabled by default; they matter when something is not behaving, not day to day.
* **Controller outlets** — created *only* on accounts with no Anthem Valve. Where a valve
  exists it owns the outlets, as switches.

The controller's view of a session driven through the valve's own API is unreliable —
measured across 95 such episodes: 51 reported immediately, 12 late, 32 never, and
preset-driven openings never (0 of 15). Outlet entities sourced from it on such an account
would freeze through an unpredictable share of showers, which is worse than not existing.

    is gone the controller, the account and this integration are all healthy, so

class ValvePresetActiveSensor(KohlerValveEntity, BinarySensorEntity):
    """Whether a stored preset or experience is currently driving the valve.

    From `presetOrExperienceId`, and it answers **"is a preset driving this"** — never "is
    water running". Two consequences worth knowing, both measured:

    * It **latches for the whole session.** Changing temperature, flow, or which outlets are
      open does not clear it, so it stays on even once the shower bears no resemblance to the
      preset as saved.
    * It is cleared by **both pause and stop** — any `0x40` or `00`/`00`.

    Opening an outlet directly leaves this off with water flowing, which is the normal case
    for anything driven from Home Assistant.

    It also has a bearing on the run-time cutoff: a cutoff during a preset-driven session
    pauses *every* zone the preset owns, not only the one that expired.

    **Known false negative: a preset started during warm-up.** The valve applies the preset's
    valve word but never sets `presetOrExperienceId`, so this reads OFF while the preset is
    demonstrably in effect — and it does not correct itself when warm-up ends, because
    warm-up ending pauses the valve and ends the session. All 12 `warmUpInProgress` samples
    in the capture corpus carry a preset id of `0`. This is the device's behaviour, not a
    decode problem, and it is reported rather than papered over: guessing "a preset is
    probably running" from a warm-up flag would be inventing state. Pair it with
    `select.anthem_valve_warmup` and the valve word if the distinction matters. Full evidence in `docs/gcs/api.md`.
