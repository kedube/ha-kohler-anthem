"""Diagnostics for Kohler Anthem — the "Download diagnostics" button.

One report, many buttons: the config entry and every device page (the Anthem Valve and
each Anthem Plus controller) all describe the **whole installation**, by design — a
hardware report should cover everything, because the products are one plumbing system and
half a picture has repeatedly misled this project (see ``docs/architecture.md``). Every
device appears in ``valves`` and ``controllers`` whichever button was pressed.

Two things do follow the button: ``requested_for``, naming it, and the singular ``valve``
/ ``controller`` blocks, which describe **that** device. Those singular keys exist only so
a report from a single-device account reads as it always has; on an account with several,
pressing the second valve's button and getting the first valve's limits under a
``valve_1`` label is precisely the half-picture this module is meant to prevent.

What this is for: **hardware validation reports.** Every claim in this integration is
verified against exactly one installation (a K-28212 + controller), and the support matrix
in the README only moves on evidence. This file is the evidence: model and outlet split as
detected, which devices exist, what the valve and controller are reporting, whether limits
arrived. A user on unverified hardware attaches this JSON to a "hardware report" issue and
that model's row can be marked verified.

What deliberately stays out: credentials (refresh token), account identity (username,
tenant id), and device identity (device ids, serial numbers, the mobile registration id).
Kohler device serials double as cloud addresses, so they are redacted the same way tokens
are — presence and SKU are enough for validation. Preset and favorite *names* are the
owner's own words and stay out too; counts carry the signal.

**Two mechanisms, because they answer different questions.** `TO_REDACT` names the keys whose
values must never appear, which works for the record shapes this module reproduces
deliberately. `_version_fields` is the exception: it walks fields no capture has covered, on
accounts unlike the owner's, so it cannot be driven by a key list — it takes only
version-shaped keys and then checks the *value* as well, because a device id
(`gcs-sio32343h7`) is short enough to pass any sane length ceiling.
