"""Buttons for the Kohler Anthem integration.

One so far: start a new raw MQTT capture file. That exists because the natural way to get a
fresh capture — restart Home Assistant — costs a full reload, drops the MQTT connection, and
**clears the run-time cutoff tracking** (`ZoneCutoffDetector.forget()` on reconnect). None
of which anyone wants in the middle of a sequence of shower experiments.

Pressing this rolls the file instead: the current one is closed and a new one opened, so each
experiment lands in its own file rather than being separated by timestamp afterwards.
