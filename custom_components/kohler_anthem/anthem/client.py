"""Authenticated REST client for the Kohler Konnect cloud API.

Wraps :class:`~.auth.KohlerAuth` with the headers every call needs, transparent token
refresh, and translation of Kohler's two error channels into exceptions.

Kohler reports failure in two places and you have to check both:

* the HTTP status, and
* a ``statusCode`` field **inside** a 200/400 body — ``900`` means the device is offline,
  ``902`` means it is running and refuses the edit.

A request can therefore "succeed" with HTTP 200 and still have done nothing.
