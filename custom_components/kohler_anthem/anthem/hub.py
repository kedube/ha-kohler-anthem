"""Commands for the Anthem Plus system controller (SKU ``HUB``).

The HUB is favorite-centric. There is **no direct "set outlet/temperature/flow now"**
command: to run a specific configuration you create or edit a *favorite* and activate it.
The only direct commands are bare on/off for the controller's own stored default
(``valvecontrol`` / ``steamcontrol``) and ``stopall``.

Two constraints shape every caller:

* **Editing a favorite is rejected while the system runs** (``statusCode 902``), surfaced
  as :class:`~.client.DeviceRunning`. Activating one is allowed at any time — so the
  practical pattern is to pre-create a favorite per state you want and switch between
  them by activation, never editing at runtime.
* **An all-off favorite is not the same as ``stopall``.** Activating an empty favorite
  stops the outputs but leaves the system reporting that favorite as running; only
  ``stopall`` fully idles it.
