"""Detect the valve closing a zone because it hit its own maximum run time.

The valve enforces a `maximumRunTime` — 900 s on the reference install, 3600 s before it was
reconfigured — and shuts the water off once it has been running that long. Nothing on the
wire says "I did this because of the timer": `currentSystemState` reads `normalOperation` in
every captured status message, and a timed-out close looks exactly like someone pressing
stop.

**The timer is per ZONE, not per outlet.** This is the thing that took two attempts to get
right, so it is worth stating precisely:

* The clock starts when a zone goes from *nothing flowing* to *something flowing*.
* It **does not reset when outlets change within the zone.** Opening a second head, closing
  the first, swapping between them — none of it touches the timer.
* At the limit the valve pauses that zone (`0x40`) and clears its mask.

An earlier version of this module timed each outlet from when *that outlet* opened. It fired
correctly only when a zone happened to run one outlet, unchanged, for the whole session, and
silently missed everything else — any mid-shower outlet change resets the per-outlet clock
while the valve's own clock keeps running. Replayed over the corpus it finds 8 of the 11 real
cutoffs; in the one logged session where the owner actually moved between shower heads, it
found 1 of 4.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every decision this module makes is written to the cutoff debug log — including
# the ones where it decides NOT to fire, which nothing else records. When this
# feature misbehaves, read `cutoff_*.jsonl` alongside `mqtt_raw_*.jsonl` in the
# same directory; see `cutoff_log.py`.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ⚠️ ANNOUNCED LIMITS ONLY. NOTHING HERE INFERS A LIMIT FROM BEHAVIOUR.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The only limits this detector will ever fire on are the `maximumRunTime` values the valve
# itself announced, as persisted in `CONF_OUTLET_RUN_TIMES`. A duration that matches nothing
# announced is recorded and left alone, however suggestive it looks.
#
# A `MissedCutoffWatcher` used to live here and guess: it collected declined pauses and, on
# three landing within 2 s of each other, offered the duration as a "suspected limit" for the
# caller to promote. **Removed 2026-08-17, deliberately, and it should not come back.**
#
# It was built when it was believed the valve had one run-time limit and the only way to miss
# one was not being told. That turned out to be wrong: a **preset carries its own `time`**, a
# second limit independent of `maximumRunTime`, and it is the lower of the two that stops the
# shower (`docs/gcs/api.md`, "two independent timers"). So repeated identical durations are
# not evidence of an unannounced hardware limit at all — they are the normal signature of a
# preset the owner configured. Presets 2-10 are user settings; restarting a shower that ended
# on one would override a deliberate choice.
#
# The mechanism is understood now and there is nothing left to infer. `test_no_limit_guessing.py`
# in the offline suite asserts this module has no source of limits but its caller's.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why duration alone is enough to discriminate

Across **156** completed zone-open periods in the capture corpus (2026-08-07 to 08-14,
spanning the reconfiguration from a 3600 s limit to 900 s):

| | |
|---|---|
| Zone **paused** within 10 s of a limit | **11** — 899.84, 899.93, 899.95, 899.96, 900.01, 900.07, 3598.68, 3599.68, 3599.74, 3599.85, 3599.85 |
| Every other pause (54) | 1.9 s to 1831 s, none closer than **334 s** to a limit |
| Zones ended by a **stop** (`0x00`) rather than a pause (91) | none closer than **123 s** to a limit |

Every cutoff lands within **1.32 s** of its limit; the nearest pause that was not a cutoff is
over five minutes away. The two groups do not come close to touching.

Note what the third row *used to* buy: requiring the pause flag removed 91 of the 156 periods
from consideration outright, including every stop issued from Home Assistant or the Anthem
Plus controller. Duration then only had to separate 11 cutoffs from 54 other pauses.

### ⚠️ REQUIRED AGAIN — 2026-08-18, owner's decision, after five case studies

**A cutoff must carry `0x40`.** The 2026-08-17 change below is reverted; the section is kept
because its measurement is still the best description of the corpus, and because the reason it
was made turned out to be a configuration problem rather than a protocol one.

**What we did not know on 2026-08-17:** the Anthem Plus controller runs its own maximum
shower duration, independently of the valve's `maximumRunTime`, and the two were set to
different values — 900 s on the valve, 3600 s on the controller. The controller's longer clock
expired mid-leg and stopped a shower still in use. That looked like a valve behaviour the
detector was missing. It was two timers disagreeing.

**What five case studies established** (`docs/case_studies/`):

* Only the **GCS valve** cuts with `0x40`. Only the **controller** cuts with `0x00`.
* The valve fires slightly **early** — measured −0.08 to −0.23 s against its limit.
* The controller fires slightly **late** — measured +0.20, +0.557 and +1.004 s.
* So **with both durations set to the same value the valve's pause always arrives first**,
  by ~1.1 s in the one session where both were at 900 s, and it is always the actionable
  signal. The controller's `0x00` then lands on a zone already restored.
* Across the whole corpus, **not one genuine max-duration cutoff took the shape "both zones
  transitioned from flowing to zero"** — all 16 such transitions are `stopall`, test scripts
  or somebody ending a shower.

**So the rule is: match the two Max Shower Durations, and require the pause flag.** That
restores the strong property the 2026-08-17 change gave up — a deliberate stop is never
undone, whoever issued it — and costs nothing as long as the durations agree.

⚠️ **If they do not agree**, the controller can fire alone with `0x00` and the shower will not
come back. That is the safe failure direction (water off, not water on), and it is logged at
WARNING naming the likely cause, plus journalled with its own verdict so it is visible in
analysis. Do not re-fix it by accepting `0x00` again; fix the configuration.

⚠️ **Known accepted risk, unchanged:** pressing off on the **first-generation touchscreen**
writes `0x40` on **both zones** (case study 4), which is byte-identical to a preset-driven
cutoff. Ending a shower from that screen within `CUTOFF_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` of the limit will
restart the water. There is no discriminator in the data — requiring both zones to match would
break the preset case, which is exactly what `also_paused` exists for. The owner has weighed
this: a real installation sets the longest available duration (60 min), so the window is ten
seconds in an hour, and 15 min was only ever used to make experiments run faster.

### The 2026-08-17 reasoning, superseded but kept for the record

**A `0x00` stop is now treated exactly like a `0x40` pause.** The rule above described the
corpus accurately and still does; what it missed is that the valve has a *second* way to end
a session, and it does not pause.

Measured 2026-08-18 (local 2026-08-17 evening), a shower with Endless Shower on and
`maximumRunTime` 900 s on all six outlets:

```text
17:43:07  zone 1 opens                                     <- the session clock starts here
17:58:07  paused 0x40 at 899.88s  -> restarted (1.45s off)
18:13:08  paused 0x40 at 899.91s  -> restarted (2.19s off)
18:28:10  paused 0x40 at 899.76s  -> restarted (1.54s off)
18:43:07  STOPPED 0x00 at 895.47s -> ignored, water stayed off
          3595.02s of flow + 5.18s of restart gaps = 3600.20s wall clock
```

The final leg came up short of its own 900 s limit by exactly the time the water had spent
off during the three restarts. **Mechanism confirmed by the owner: the two devices each run
their own maximum-duration timer, and they signal differently.**

    GCS valve   maximumRunTime, per outlet   900 s here    writes 0x40  (pause)
    Anthem Plus HUB   its own max duration   60 min here   writes 0x00  (stop)

So `0x00` is not a strange valve behaviour — it is the controller stopping the shower with
the same plain stop every HUB-issued stop uses. The HUB's clock keeps running through our
1.2-2.2 s restore gaps, which is why the ceiling arrives mid-leg. The owner was still
showering — zone 2 ran on for another six minutes, untouched, because the HUB times per zone.

**What this costs, stated plainly:** a deliberate stop that lands within
`CUTOFF_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` of an announced limit will now be restarted. Somebody who ends a
shower at 14:50-15:10 by the wall panel gets the water back. Two things still stand between
that and a restart: `LOCAL_WRITE_GRACE_SECONDS` covers every stop Home Assistant itself
issued, and the duration window remains narrow — of the 91 stops in the corpus, none came
closer than 123 s to a limit, and the one that did was this genuine cutoff at 4.53 s. The
journal keeps recording `paused` on every `flow_end`, so the two populations stay separable
in analysis even though the detector no longer separates them.

⚠️ **This does not on its own catch the ceiling at other Max Shower Duration settings.** A
duration must still match an announced `maximumRunTime` within tolerance, and 3600 s only
lands near one because the limit is currently 900 s. At 20 or 25 minutes the ceiling falls
mid-leg and is logged as an ordinary unexplained stop. Closing that needs the session clock
itself — see `docs/gcs/api.md`, "the 60-minute session ceiling".

This module only *reports*. It never sends anything, holds no Home Assistant imports, and is
deliberately separable from whatever a caller chooses to do with the answer.

#
# Every cutoff ever measured landed within **1.32 s** of the limit, and all but one within
# 0.35 s. The nearest pause that was *not* a cutoff was 334 s away. So anything from about
# 2 s to 300 s "works" on the evidence, and the number is a judgement about which way to fail.
#
# It fails asymmetrically, so this is deliberately tight rather than generous:
#
# * **Too tight** — a real cutoff is missed, the water stays off, somebody turns it back on.
# * **Too loose** — a deliberate stop is mistaken for a cutoff and the water comes back on by
#   itself, which is the outcome this whole feature exists to avoid causing accidentally.
#
# **Tightened from 10 s to 2 s on 2026-08-19.** The 10 s figure was set against a worst
# observed deviation of 1.32 s — a number from the 2026-08-13/14 flow-experiment and
# valve-reboot era, which is now excluded from the corpus (see `pause_resolution.py`).
#
# Every valve cutoff measured since the corpus floor lands within **0.232 s** of its limit:
#
#     3599.768 s vs 3600   -0.232      case study 1
#      899.918 s vs  900   -0.082      case study 3

#      899.79 / 899.78                 case study 6
#
# 2 s is still **8.6x the worst of those**, and these are the detector's own measurements, so
# MQTT delivery jitter is already inside them.
#
# It buys a fivefold reduction in the one accepted risk: pressing off on the first-generation
# touchscreen writes `0x40` on both zones, byte-identical to a preset-driven cutoff, so ending
# a shower within this window of the limit restarts the water. That exposure is now 2 s in
# whatever the duration is, not 10.
#
# The case that keeps it from being looser: **a GCS-only install has no Anthem Plus**, so the
# touchscreen is the primary control surface — and a touchscreen pause writes `0x40`, exactly
# like a cutoff, with no `note_local_write()` guard because Home Assistant did not send it.
# Somebody who knows their shower cuts out at 15 minutes and pauses it at 14:55 is a
# plausible user, not a contrived one, and they must not have the water restarted on them.

# does not. Do not raise this without measurements from hardware that needs it.

#
# Why this is not the removed `MissedCutoffWatcher` in disguise: that inferred a *valve* limit

#
# **The rule: a whole number of MINUTES, overshot by a fraction of a second.**
#
# `maxshowerduration` is stored in **minutes** (`docs/hub/local_api.md` §3a), so the

#     300 s setting   +0.57, +0.78 s     2026-08-19
#     180 s setting   +0.46, +0.64 s     2026-08-19
#
# The valve, by contrast, fires **early** (-0.08 to -0.23 s), so a late-only window separates
# the two devices cleanly. It also excludes the 1800 s preset timer, which fires early at
# 1799.9 s.
#
# ⚠️ **Superseded 2026-08-20: the four-value dropdown is NOT the candidate set.** This started
# life as a fixed `(900, 1800, 2700, 3600)` because the vendor UI only offers 15/30/45/60 min.
# The local API accepts **anything** — 3, 5, 75 and 120 minutes were all written and enforced

        replayed, so a later cutoff's record is as complete as the first one's.

        Why this exists: the valve does not reliably announce a restored zone. Across the
        18 restores in the clean corpus, 17 drew a ``GCS_SOLO_STS`` within 0.06–1.08 s —
        and one drew nothing for **176.77 s** while the water demonstrably ran (2026-08-19

        Restores only — deliberately not every opening write. A restore reopens water the
        valve was demonstrably running a second earlier, so the write taking effect is the
        overwhelmingly probable outcome; an ordinary open can be accepted by the cloud and
        dropped by the valve, and anchoring one that never ran would hold a false clock —
        against which a *manual* pause landing within tolerance of a limit would read as a
        cutoff and restart water nobody is running. :meth:`update` still corrects both
        directions: any snapshot showing the zone empty pops the anchor (the `0x40` pause
        resolution guarantees such a snapshot within ~120 s of a failed restore), and one

        configured for the outlets in that zone (empty where the valve has not said).

        A zone counts as *flowing* when it has a non-empty mask and is not paused. A cutoff
        is a flowing zone that stops flowing **with the `0x40` pause flag set**, having
        flowed for one of its limits.

        **The pause flag is required**, restored 2026-08-18 at the owner's instruction after
        five case studies showed the `0x00` that had motivated dropping it was the Anthem
        Plus controller's own ceiling, fired because the two Max Shower Durations were set to
        different values. Only the valve cuts with `0x40`, and it fires marginally early, so
        with the durations matched its pause always arrives first and is always the
        actionable signal. A `0x00` at a matching duration is declined, logged at WARNING
        naming the likely cause, and journalled with its own `reason`. The full reasoning and
        what it costs are in this module's docstring; `paused` reaches the journal on every
        `flow_end` either way, so the two populations stay separable in analysis.
