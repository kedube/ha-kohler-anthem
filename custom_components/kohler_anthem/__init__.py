"""The Kohler Anthem integration.

Supports both products in the Anthem line, and works with either or both on an account —
any number of each, every valve and every controller as its own device:

* **Anthem** (SKU ``GCS``) — the digital valve with built-in Wi-Fi. Full outlet,
  temperature, and flow control.
* **Anthem Plus** (SKU ``HUB``) — the Linux system controller that adds music, lighting,
  and steam. Controlled through favorites.

State is push-only over Azure IoT Hub MQTT — there is no polling interval. REST is read on
events: once at setup and again on every MQTT (re)connect, because the broker replays
nothing on connect. All protocol handling lives in the bundled ``anthem`` package,
which has no Home Assistant imports and can be tested offline.

    This integration writes to its own config entry while running — the rotating refresh

    one, which it does unprompted and can do mid-shower. Every one of those writes fires this
    listener. Reloading on them would flap all entities to ``unavailable``, drop the MQTT
    connection with its warm-up, and reset the run-time cutoff's zone clocks while the valve's
    own timer kept running.

    snapshot taken when the coordinator was built. ``RELOAD_IGNORED_DATA_KEYS`` and
    ``RELOAD_IGNORED_OPTION_KEYS`` in ``const.py`` say what is excluded and why; anything
    else — including a key nobody anticipated — reloads.

    ⚠️ **Do not compare against ``coordinator.entry``.** That is the same object Home
    Assistant mutates in place, so it always equals ``entry`` and this listener becomes dead
    code that returns early every time. That was the defect here until 2026-08-17; see
