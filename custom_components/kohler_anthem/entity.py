"""Shared entity bases.

Two kinds of device are registered, never merged, because they behave differently and their
state arrives on different schedules:

* **Anthem Valve** — a digital valve. Authoritative for outlets, temperature, and flow.
  An account can have several, each its own device bound to its own
  :class:`~.coordinator.Valve`.
* **Anthem Plus** — a system controller. Owns favorites, music, steam, and lighting. An
  account can have several — one per bathroom — and each is its own device, bound to its
  own :class:`~.coordinator.Controller`.

A valve and a controller are usually the same physical shower reached through two different
touchscreens, but presenting them as one device would imply a consistency that does not
exist.

The SKU strings ``GCS`` and ``HUB`` appear nowhere a user can see them. They exist only in
Kohler's API — not in the app, the manual, or on the hardware — so every user-facing string
uses the names Kohler itself shows: "Anthem" and "Anthem Plus".

    same name — `Rainhead Max Run Time` beside `Rainhead` — and a sensor platform reaching
    into a switch platform for it would couple the two for no reason.

    Three rules, in order:

    * **The fixture name wins** where the valve's `outLetType` maps to a confirmed one —
      `Rainhead` says what the entity does in a way `Outlet 1` never can.
    * **The zone number is dropped on a single-zone valve**, per :func:`zone_label`.
    * **An unknown code falls back to the position** — `Zone 1 Outlet 3`. Naming an outlet
      after a code nobody has confirmed would be inventing a fixture; the number is honest.

    Read **once, at construction**. Per-outlet types arrive gradually over MQTT and via the
    REST seed, so a valve that has not announced yet names its outlets by position and picks
    up fixture names on the next restart. Renaming entities live would change their ids
