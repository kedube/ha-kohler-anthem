"""Coordinator: holds the MQTT stream, the REST client, and per-device state.

State is **push-only**. MQTT carries every change as it happens and there is no polling
interval at all — REST is read on events, never on a clock.

Three things this has to get right:

* **Cold start.** MQTT is event-driven and silent until the shower next changes, so a
  restart would leave every entity unknown. One REST read at setup seeds everything.
* **Reconnects.** The broker replays nothing on connect: measured across 27 sessions, the
  first message is always a change event and six sessions received nothing for hours. So
  every connect re-seeds, which is what makes dropping the poll safe.
* **Token rotation.** B2C issues a new refresh token on every refresh and invalidates the
  old one. Losing it strands the account, so it is written back to the config entry
  whenever it changes.

        leaves the valve holding the new value on some outlets and the old one on others.
        That is not hypothetical: it is what produced the `outlets_agree: false` this

        its outlets happen to agree.

        ⚠️ **They do not always agree — observed 2026-09-10.** One of the owner's two valves
        read 3600 s on all three outlets at 08:38 and then 1800 s on two of them with 3600 s
        still on the third at 15:22. Until then every outlet on every install seen had
        matched, and comments here and in `sensor.py` said so as though it were guaranteed.

        **A mixed zone is a lost write, not a configuration.** There is one duration setting;
        the app writes it one outlet at a time and stops at the first failure
        (`docs/gcs/api.md`), so a dropped call strands the old value on the outlets it never
        reached.

        Which makes offering every distinct value as a candidate exactly right, and for a
        better reason than the one originally written here: the valve really may enforce
        either number, because its outlets really are holding different ones. Matching any of
        them keeps such a zone protected, and the cost is a handful of extra 10 s windows in a
        15-minute session that would each also have to coincide with a `0x40` pause to fire.

        ⚠️ **`maximumRunTime` only. Preset timers are deliberately excluded — do not add
        them here.** A preset carries its own `time` (`GCS_PRESET_STS`), a *second*
        independent limit that stops a preset-driven session early whenever it is lower than
        `maximumRunTime`; this install currently runs a 1800 s preset under a 3600 s hardware
        gate, so it is the preset that stops the shower. Those stops land as
        `verdict: "ignored"` with a large `off_by`, and that is the intended outcome: the
        hardware gate cutting a shower short is what this feature exists to defeat, whereas a
        preset ending at its own configured duration is the system doing what the user asked.
        Restarting those would override a setting somebody chose on purpose. Owner's decision,

        """Put back exactly what was flowing in the zones the valve cut.

        The valve clears the zone's mask in the same message that reports the cut, so current
        state says nothing about what the shower was doing. Two independent records survive
        it — the detector's own pre-pause mask, which is the precise instant before the cut,
        and `_last_open_masks` as a fallback — and either beats rebuilding from a mask that
        has already been wiped. Measured live: rebuilding from current state brought a
        four-outlet shower back as outlet 4 alone.

        **A second zone is restored too, but only if it is also paused.** Normally a cut
        pauses just the expiring zone and leaves the other's mask untouched — 10 of the 11
        cutoffs in the corpus. The exception is when a preset is driving the shower: the cut
        is internally `{preset, action:"Off"}`, so it pauses *every* zone the preset owns,
        and the zone that did not expire has had its mask wiped just as thoroughly. Its
        timing proves nothing (1831 s in the one captured instance), so the pause flag is
        what identifies it.

        A zone that is neither cut nor paused is re-sent exactly as it reads now, so anything
        changed there in the second between the cut and this write survives.

        **Flow is restored from `cut.reading`, not left to `DEFAULT_FLOW_PERCENT`.** This is
        deliberately a different rule from `async_apply_valve`'s ordinary writes, which never
        inherit flow — that rule exists so nothing silently *adopts* the touchscreen's last
        value on an unrelated write. A restore is not that: it is putting back a value this
        code itself observed running a moment before it force-closed the zone, which is
        squarely what "restore" should mean. Measured live 2026-08-14: a preset-driven shower
        running at 82.5% was cut and had been coming back at 100% — 2.9x on zone 1, which had
        no outlet open at all. `async_apply_valve` honours whatever flow byte it is given
        exactly, uncapped and unscaled against any ceiling (verified on hardware; see
        `docs/gcs/api.md#flow-the-valve-obeys-the-touchscreen-is-what-computes-limits`), so
        replaying the observed value reproduces the observed experience regardless of whether
        the valve is calibrated — there is no ceiling to reason about either way. **Covers the
        `also_paused` zone too**, from `_last_open_flows` — the same snapshot-of-last-resort
        `_last_open_masks` provides for its mask, and for the same reason: the detector never
        classifies that zone as a cutoff (its own duration matches nothing), so it has no
        `ZoneCutoff.reading` to draw on. Falls back to `DEFAULT_FLOW_PERCENT` only when
        neither source has a value for that zone.

        The escape hatch for everything the entities do not model — an outlet combination,
        flow value, or temperature the UI cannot express. It is the same endpoint every other
        control path uses; the only difference is that the caller supplies the words.

        Both words are validated with ``normalize_word`` before anything is sent. Malformed
        input is rejected locally rather than posted to a device that opens water valves, and
        the decoded meaning is logged so the journal records what was actually asked for.

        ``zone2_hex`` omitted **re-sends zone 2's current state**, so zone 2 keeps doing
        whatever it was doing. It emphatically does *not* send ``00000000``.

        That sentinel means "no valve addressed", and on a two-valve system it is measured to
        make the device **discard the entire command** — `v1=00000000 v2=11849C01` opened

        gets a well-formed word with mask ``0x00``; only a valve that does not physically
        exist gets the sentinel, which is why a single-zone model still sends it here.

        The protocol has no partial write — every POST carries both zones — so "leave zone 2
        alone" can only be expressed by sending zone 2's own current word, which is what this

        changed on 2026-08-13 because **a pause is indistinguishable from the valve's own
        run-time cutoff** — the cutoff is internally ``{preset, action:"Off"}`` and writes
        exactly the same ``0x40``. With the restart-on-cutoff option enabled, Home Assistant
        turning the shower off and the valve timing out looked identical on the wire, leaving
        only `note_local_write()`'s 30 s grace between "stopped" and "helpfully restarted".

        ✅ **The strong guarantee is back, 2026-08-18: a stop issued from here can never be
        undone by Endless Shower.** The detector requires the ``0x40`` pause flag again, and
        this method writes ``0x00``, so its stops are outside the restart-eligible set
        entirely — by shape, not by timing.

        The requirement was briefly dropped on 2026-08-17, when a real cutoff arrived as
        ``0x00`` and was ignored. Five case studies established that as **two maximum
        durations set to different values** rather than a protocol gap: only the GCS valve
        cuts with ``0x40`` and only the Anthem Plus controller with ``0x00``, the valve fires
        marginally early and the controller marginally late, so with the two durations equal
        the pause always arrives first. See `anthem/runtime_cutoff.py` and
        `docs/case_studies/`.

        `note_local_write()`'s 30 s grace still applies and is now belt-and-braces rather than
        the only protection.

        Still routed through `async_apply_valve` rather than `GcsDevice.async_turn_off()`,
        which would write a flat 38.0 °C to both zones — this preserves each zone's own
