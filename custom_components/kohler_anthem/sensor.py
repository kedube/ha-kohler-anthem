"""Valve status and diagnostics.

One headline entity, ``Status``, collapses what the valve is doing into a single value so a
dashboard needs one card rather than four booleans.

Everything else here is diagnostic and **disabled by default**: useful when something looks
wrong, noise otherwise. Enable them individually from the device page.

**No measured-temperature or measured-flow entities.** Bytes 4-6 of the status word carry
live sensor feedback, and on this hardware they read zero in every message ever captured —
including 239 with an outlet open. Entities that can only ever report ``unknown`` are noise,
so they were removed. The decode is intact and both values still appear as attributes on the
hex sensor, where a zero reads as data rather than as a broken entity.

    The headline entity, and **the one place the two devices are deliberately merged.**

    the controller cannot see a valve-driven session and would contradict it. Warm-up is the
    exception: the valve and the controller each have their *own* warm-up function, and
    either one running means water is about to move. Reading only the valve would miss a
    controller-initiated warm-up entirely.

    That asymmetry is intentional and runs one way only. `ControllerStatusSensor` stays
    purely HUB-derived — it exists to show what the controller believes, and folding valve
    state into it would destroy the comparison it is there to provide.

    **Named `System Status` since 0.19.0**, because system-level is exactly what it is:
    warm-up and pause are properties of the whole valve on this hardware, not of a zone, so
    there is no per-zone `Status` this could ever be one of. On a multi-zone valve
    `Shower Active 1` / `Shower Active 2` answer the per-zone question beside it.

    switches and temperature controls, read the word off here, and paste it into the service.

    **Reports the 8-character command half**, uppercased. Two deliberate normalisations:

    * *Truncated* — the device sends 16 characters, whose second half is live sensor
      feedback. On this hardware measured temperature and flow read zero in every message

      the sensor flipped case depending on whether the value arrived over MQTT or came from
      the REST seed, which is a poor thing to ask anyone to copy from.

    capture sessions, no attribute key resembling pause, hold, or suspend appears anywhere,
    and per-zone ``status`` takes exactly two values, ``ON`` and ``OFF`` — 264 and 256
    observations. Pause is a GCS concept: bit ``0x40`` of the valve command word. A paused
    session therefore surfaces here as ``Idle``, and the only way to distinguish it is
    ``sensor.anthem_valve_system_status``, which is on the other device by design.

    Sources, all HUB-native — nothing here reads the valve:

    * **Warming Up** — ``data.showerwarmup`` on ``SHOWER_VALVE_STS``
    * **Water Running** — any zone's ``status`` is ``ON``
    * **Idle** — everything else

    Warm-up outranks running because warm-up *is* running water: all 9 observed warm-up
    messages also had both zones ON, so testing "running" first would mask every one of them.

    different device, so the two do not collide; the unique id is unchanged, for the reason
    given on :class:`ValveStatusSensor`.

    Seeded from the ``hub-state`` REST read at setup and on each reconnect, then driven by
    MQTT — the same path as every other controller entity. Without that seed it would read
    ``unknown`` from every restart until the controller next said something, which has been
    as long as 11.9 hours.

    Reported in the **account's** unit rather than Celsius: unlike the GCS valve word, which
    is always tenths of a degree Celsius, the controller sends whatever unit the account is
    configured for. Captured values of ``102`` alongside a 38.8 °C valve setpoint confirm it
    is following the Fahrenheit preference.

    ``null`` while the zone is off, which is why this has no ``state_class`` — it is a live
